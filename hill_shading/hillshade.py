        You can specify data properties and terrain height in separate parameters. The data array
        determines the (unshaded) color, the terrain is used to calculate the shading component.
        If the terrain is left to None, the data array will be used as terrain as well. The terrain
        parameter can also be used to scale the surface heights. E.g. use: terrain = data * 10
        
        The relief is calculated from one or more artificial light sources which positions are
        specified by their azimuth and elevation angle. Each lamp can have a weight, which 
        corresponds to its strength. Ambient light is light that reaches the surface via indirect 
        illumination. If the ambient weight set to 0, pixels that are not illuminated by any lamp 
        are rendered completely black, which is usually undesirable.   
        
        The algorithm uses a color map to color the relief. The minimum and maximum values of the
        color scale can be specified by vmin and vmax (or by giving a normalization function). If
        these are all None (the default), the color bar will be auto-scaled.
        
        The blend_function is the function that merges the color and shade components into the
        final result. It was found that rbg_blending (the default) gives the best results. If set
        to no_blending, only the intensities of the shade component are returned. This is useful
        for debugging.

        :param azimuth: azimuth angle [degrees] of the lamp direction(s). Can be scalar or list.
        :param elevation: elevation angle [degrees] of the lamp direction(s). Can be scalar or list.
        :param ambient_weight: the relative strength of the ambient illumination (default = 1)
        :param lamp_weight: the relative strength of the lamp or lamps (default = 5)
